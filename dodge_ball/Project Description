# Project "Dodge_ball"
# Date of creation: 26.02.2024
# Python

This is my favorite project. I had a lot of fun creating it. In this project I created everything myself including the graphics for the game. 
When creating this project I wanted to create a cool game completely from scratch, without any help or tips. 
I gave myself a two goals: first goal was to think up and brainstorm solutions and mechanics in the game completely by myself. The second goal was to see if I could do an object-oriented project in python.
This game was made in breaks between classes at university.
